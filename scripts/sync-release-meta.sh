# Cargo.toml's [workspace.package] version) — safe to re-run, each update
# is skipped once it is already in place.

#
# Deliberately NOT handled here: the flatpak manifest's tag/commit pin and
# cargo-sources.json. The commit hash only exists once the tag is created,
# so scripts/submit-flathub.sh owns those — run it after tagging.
